This is the Dynamical model of nuclear division cycles during early
embryogenesis of Drosophila, without StringT regulation. so ksstg=kdstg=0.
Figure1B has been simulated by MathSBML. Curator changed model from only one
compartment into two compartments according to the paper. Detail explaination
of the models are in the supplement information of the paper.The author didn't
specify which compartment Xm, Stgm, Xp are located, we assume that they locate
in cytoplasm.

Some of the parameter values for the equations are dimensionless parameters.
